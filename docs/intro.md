> A Vite plugin to seamlessly integrate with Tauri for desktop application development.

## What is Tauri?

[Tauri](https://tauri.app/) is a framework for building tiny, blazingly fast binaries for all major desktop platforms. It allows developers to build applications for the major desktop platforms â€“ using web technologies â€“ bundled in a native shell for distribution.

This plugin integrates with Tauri to provide a seamless experience for Vite users, automatically initializing and configuring Tauri development and builds with your Vite project.

## How It Works

1. **Add the plugin to your Vite config** - Import and use the plugin in your Vite configuration
2. **Start your Vite dev server** - The plugin automatically launches Tauri alongside your Vite app
3. **Build your application** - When building your app, the plugin configures Tauri to use your Vite output directory

The plugin handles all the complexity of integration, making it easy to develop Tauri desktop applications with Vite.

## Environment Variables

- `TAURI_PATH_DEPTH` - Controls how deep the plugin searches for Tauri configuration files (default: `3`)

## CLI Arguments

You can pass arguments to the Tauri CLI by adding them after a double dash (`--`) and the `-t` or `--tauri` flag:

```bash
# Development mode
npm run dev -- -t --debug

# Build mode
npm run build -- -t --target nsis --debug
```
